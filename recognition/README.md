# Recognition Tasks
Various recognition tasks solved in deep learning frameworks.

Tasks may include:
* Image Segmentation
* Object detection
* Graph node classification
* Image super resolution
* Disease classification
* Generative modelling with StyleGAN and Stable Diffusion

* # UPDATED README for S4878126's Project - No.7 in Task Sheet, a vector quantised variational autoencoder over the HipMRI dataset.
* Readme will be updated further in later commits.
