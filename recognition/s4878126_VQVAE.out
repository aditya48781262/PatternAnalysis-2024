Matplotlib created a temporary cache directory at /scratch/209373/matplotlib-zokpnu37 because the default path (/cache/matplotlib) is not a writable directory; it is highly recommended to set the MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable to a writable directory, in particular to speed up the import of Matplotlib and to better support multiprocessing.
Modules are using cuda.
